# Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [D&D Character Background Generator](https://github.com/dmm4613/dnd-char-background) - A research project working with LLMs to generate text.
- [Video Game Ratings EDA](https://github.com/dmm4613/video-game-ratings) - I look at the ESRB ratings and explore their efficacy.
- [Online Gaming Behavior EDA](https://github.com/dmm4613/online-gaming-behavior-eda) - Do people enjoy hard and easy games? Are women playing more games than men?
